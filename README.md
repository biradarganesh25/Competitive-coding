# Competitive-coding
Contains various coding answers to questions from multiple online platforms. 

Started this cause I got annoyed when trying to do some SPOJ Problems, cause they're clearly too lazy to maintain good classification of their problems.

Here's my two cents regarding various platforms:

Hackerrank : Awesome interface, average problem quality, not so good editorials.

Codechef : Has really good editorials, interface sucks, problem quality is really good. But they have not organised it properly, so it's a pain to search.

Topcoder : Haven't personally used this, but supposed to be good. 

Hackerearth : No clue. 

Codeforces : High quality problems with exhaustive test cases. One of the oldest and still active coding platform, many consider this as the real competitive coding platform. Many of the legends in the competitive programming scene are present here, and still active. To put it in short, if a person is able to solve more than 5 problems within the contest duration, it's safe to consider that person as an elite coder.
